# Microcontroller code for a nut sorting machine
Some classmates and I made a nut sorting machine as a class project. The machine was made to accept multiple types of hardware nuts and send each to a designated cup. Further, it was able to reject any coins introduced to the machine.
This repository holds the code used to program the machine's microcontroller. It is based on the Arduino core libraries but uses Arduino-Makefile in place of the Arduino IDE.
