Getting thie GUI to work will require a working public facing webserver that has a recent version of Ruby installed.


Start by hosting the html file 'index.html' in a preferred webserver.

On a public facing server you will also need to run the file 'back_end/server.rb'

On the computer that is connected to the arduino and has an internet connection, run the file 'end_point.rb'

You will now be able to load the index.html file in a browser and see the up to date status of the nut sorter.
