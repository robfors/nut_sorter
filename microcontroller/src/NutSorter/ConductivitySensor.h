/* 1- we set this up by specifying a array of pins.
 * 2- call setup
 * 3- when we want to make a measurment we call 'measure()'
 * 4- we repeatedly call is_result_ready() untill it returns true (we do
 *    this so the code can wait without blocking)
 * 5- call 'result()' to find out if a conductive material is present
 * repeat steps 3 to 5
 * 
 * 
 * This code works by seting up one of the pins as a current source (HIGH, with high impedance)
 * and setting the rest of the pins as a current sync (LOW, with low impedance).
 * We know a conductive material is present if the source pin's voltage is low.
 * The code will do this enough times to test for a connection between any two of the pins.
